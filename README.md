# qsofitmore
A wrapper of PyQSOFit for customization

### Features  
- Reading non-SDSS spectra without plateid, mjd and fiberid. 
- Narrow line measurements in the line MC process (which enables estimating uncertainties for narrow line parameters). 
- Dust maps and extinction laws other than SFD98 and CCM. 
- LaTeX rendering for line names in plots. 

### To do:  
- Parallel the MC processes.
- Intergrate narrow line measurements to the output fits file. 
- A simple tutorial of using `qsofitmore` with example(s).
